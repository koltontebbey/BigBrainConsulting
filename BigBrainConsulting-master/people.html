              <p>It is apparent that I come into our group with probably the most unusual background, but I believe that being involved in the physical sciences has given me a
                wealth of knowledge and a better understanding of how to problem solve. Something I lack in would be IT-related technical skills,
                which is going to prevent me from leading on some of the more technical-focused portions of our deliverables for at least the beginning of the semester.
                That is why I’m very interested in our S&D course module where I can learn more about some IT processes.
                 While I might be concerned about future obligations such as recruiting events and extracurricular activities,
                 I foresee the remaining weeks in the core becoming easier to time manage. Consequently, I look forward to working with my team members for the next few months,
                 as we have already established very good relationships. During this time I am anxious to take the leadership role on some deliverables,
                 while also acting as a complementary player in some other projects.

              <p>From the SWOT analysis, it shows that I am good at time management. I would like to plan ahead of time, for instance, I always start early on assignments.
                While doing my work, I am able to focus on the work at hand which make me an efficient worker. Since I was not from a business background, I
                 did not have many experiences in case analysis which is the part I should improve in this semester.
                 In the meanwhile, I need to practice more before presentation by using Minto Theory to showcase the key points of the case.
                 There are many opportunities to improve and get more practice. However, I spend plenty of time on job searching now since I have to find an internship or full-time job in
                 the near future. Also, I worked as a GA which I have to dedicate my time to. </p>

              <p>I believe that coming into the group I bring a diverse set of technical skills that will serve our team on the application of concepts from class. Furthermore, my technical background also allows me to grasp concepts easily in some of the more theoretical classes making explaining concepts to my classmates easy.
                However, I believe that sometimes my fast-paced over-achieving nature can sometimes harm the team as I tend to believe everyone is on my level and
                I will go too fast in trying to add things to the project and miss minute details or not notice my teammates if they are falling behind. Moreover,
                 with my various commitments my team is spread considerably thin making my need to communicate and time manage of the utmost importance to ensure
                 I am bringing as much value to my team as I possibly can.​</p>

              <p>I bring a strong work ethic to the team, and that is evident from my performance in my undergraduate course of study.
                My tech background, having minored in Computer Science, will also be an asset for the team. I’m also detail-oriented and analytical,
                which, while an asset, could also prove to be a weakness as I tend to get lost in the details every so often. I strongly defend my ideas
                if I believe that they are right and appropriate for the situation at hand, however, have been told that I am too insistent on them and am a little inflexible.
                I believe that the program will allow me opportunities to hone my leadership skills while working with the team, through our work both in cases and in assignments.
                Also, I think there would be opportunities to hone my web development skills (especially in D&S), as most of my programming work so far has been scripting and
                programming languages. The main external challenge for me is the time pressure – having to work on some research with ODT, my GA responsibilities, and extracurricular
                commitments are all pretty demanding in terms of time.​</p>
