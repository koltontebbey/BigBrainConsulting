              <p>We believe that the strongest aspect of our team is the team skills. After performing some assessments, we have found that we all are good at working on teams and being adaptive to the needs of the team.
                Moreover, as a group we are good at conflict resolution and communication allowing us to split up work and help each other out before any issues may arise later on in a project.
                We believe this to be our biggest asset in tackling challenging projects later in the semester.
                As a team, we collectively believe that our soft skills are fairly strong and will serve us well this semester. While some of us are all lacking strength in particular soft skill areas,
                collectively we have demonstrated ourselves to be strong presenters and thoughtful communicators in the program, which we believe to be some of the most important soft skills. Moreover,
                after team discussion we have found that our conflict resolution skills are relatively strong and will enable us to avoid and resolve issues before they become larger problems that could hinder
                the team as a whole.​​</p>

                <img src="img/project.png" width="120%">
                <p>On the deliverables that our team has worked on we have seen fairly good results. While we didn’t make the top 5 in the EY case competition we did receive several compliments on our slide deck.
                   There are certainly things we could have done better to improve our content though. We slightly missed the bar on what the overall problem was, which led to some misguided recommendations.
                   In the future we aim to improve communication with faculty and the sponsors to clarify questions that we have. The more recent deliverables we have worked on have yielded more generous results.
                    We have been efficient at breaking down a large project into several smaller pieces, which allows us to each tackle one portion.
                    Then, we come together and assess one another’s work and reflect on what could be improved. As the semester going forward, we had DS project, GRC project, ITS project and some individual projects.
                    Everyone on the team has the part he or she would like to work on which makes the team work efficiently and productivily. The overall team performance maintains at a high level.
                    Going forward, we hope to expand on this by really taking advantage of each of our strengths.
                    At this point we believe we are trending in the right direction in terms of project performance, but we will continually strive to give our best work.
